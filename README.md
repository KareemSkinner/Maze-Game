# Maze-Game
Uses the command line as a GUI.

* Play the game using WASD.
* Avoid the traps 'x' on the map. Your points will reset!
* Reach the goal 'G' to gain more points and to move to a new map!
* Enjoy :)

Special thanks to jdavidx9 for his First Person Shooter tutorial to get me started with the physics :)
